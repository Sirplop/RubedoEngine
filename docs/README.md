# Documentation Time
This is the start of the documentation. It is not exhaustive - if you need a specific function, you will need to look through the source. (which should be well documented!)

You should *probably* know the following:

- The barebones basics of C#.
- A vague understanding of OOP and EC.
- A whisper of a fart of knowledge about Monogame.
- How to turn lead into gold.

The main purpose of this documentation is to make you aware of how specific large systems work in general, not the nitty-gritty of it.

You should probably start at the [Table of Contents](Contents.md).
